# FHE-BERT-Tiny

This repository contains the source code for the Work-in-Progress paper called *Transformer-based Language Models and Homomorphic Encryption: an intersection with BERT-tiny*. In particular, in contains a FHE-based circuit that implements the Transformer Encoder layers of BERT-tiny (available [here](https://huggingface.co/philschmid/tiny-bert-sst2-distilled)), fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset.

### Declaration

This is a proof of concept and, even though parameters are created with $\lambda \geq 128$ security bits (according to [Homomorphic Encryption Standards](https://homomorphicencryption.org/standard)), this circuit is intended for educational purposes only.
